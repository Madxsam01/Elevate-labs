üî• Personal Firewall using Python
This project is a lightweight, customizable personal firewall developed in Python. It allows users to monitor, control, and block incoming or outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. It supports both command-line and graphical user interface (GUI) modes, making it user-friendly and flexible.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Real-time Packet Sniffing: Monitors live incoming and outgoing network packets using Scapy.

Rule-Based Filtering: Traffic can be allowed or blocked based on IP address, port number, and protocol (TCP/UDP), all defined in a JSON file.

GUI for Live Monitoring: A Tkinter-based interface shows real-time packet activity, including whether each packet is allowed or blocked, along with stats.

Rule Editor GUI: A simple GUI allows users to add or remove firewall rules without editing JSON manually.

Logging System: Suspicious or blocked packets are logged with timestamps for auditing and later analysis.

Email Alert System (Optional): Sends an email alert whenever a suspicious packet is blocked.

iptables Integration (Optional for Linux): Automatically applies blocking rules using the Linux firewall (iptables) for system-level security.

üìÅ Project Modules
firewall.py: Runs the main firewall logic via command-line interface.

gui_firewall.py: Provides a GUI that shows live packet data, traffic stats, and integrates logging and alerts.

gui_rule_editor.py: Allows users to create or update firewall rules through a simple form-based interface.

iptables_manager.py: Automatically applies block rules at the system level using iptables on Linux systems.

alert_emailer.py: Manages the sending of email alerts for flagged packets.

rules.json: A configuration file that stores user-defined rules in "allow" and "block" categories.

logs/suspicious.log: A log file that records details of blocked or suspicious packets with reasons and timestamps.

‚úÖ How It Works
The firewall starts sniffing all network traffic using Scapy.

Each packet is checked against the rules defined in rules.json.

If a packet matches a block rule, it is logged and optionally triggers an email alert.

If a packet matches an allow rule, it is permitted through.

Packets that do not match any rule are blocked by default (configurable).

GUI users can see all this activity in real-time, including how many packets were allowed or blocked.

On Linux, users can apply the same block rules to the system firewall (iptables) for more robust protection.

üì¨ Email Alerts
The firewall can be configured to send an email every time a packet is blocked. This is useful for detecting unauthorized access attempts, port scans, or intrusion attempts in real-time.
